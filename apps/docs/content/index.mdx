# Welcome to Tailgrids Docs

Tailgrids is an open-source React UI component library built on top of Tailwind CSS. It helps you build modern, responsive web interfaces faster, without reinventing common UI patterns every time.

All components are designed to be accessible, customizable, and easy to drop into real-world projects. Tailgrids works great with React-based frameworks like Next.js, React, Astro, and more.
