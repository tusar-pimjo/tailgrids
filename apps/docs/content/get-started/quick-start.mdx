# Quick Start

This guide will help you quickly set up and start using Tailgrids components in your React project.

## Initialize Tailgrids

Run the `init` command to set up Tailgrids in your project.

```bash
npx @tailgrids/cli@latest init
```

This will prompt you to:

- Select a theme for your components.
- Configure an import alias for your project.

The `init` command will create the following files:

- `tailgrids.config.json`: Configuration file for the Tailgrids CLI.
- `tailgrids.css`: The base styles for Tailgrids components.
- A `cn` utility file for merging Tailwind CSS classes.

It will also install the required dependencies (`clsx`, `@tailwindcss/forms`, and `tailwind-merge`).

## Configure Your Project

After the `init` command finishes, you'll need to follow these steps:

### **Add Styles to Your Project**

Copy the contents of the generated `tailgrids.css` file and paste them into your main CSS file (e.g., `globals.css` or `app.css`).

## Add Components

Now you can start adding Tailgrids components to your project using the `add` command.

```bash
npx @tailgrids/cli@latest add <component-name>
```

For example, to add a button component, run:

```bash
npx @tailgrids/cli@latest add button
```

This will add the `button` component to your project, and you can start using it right away.

## Import and Use Components

You can now import and use the components you've added in your application.

```typescript filename="src/app/page.tsx"
import { Button } from '@/components/core/button'; // Adjust the import path based on your alias and component location

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      <Button variant="primary">Hello Tailgrids!</Button>
    </main>
  );
}
```
