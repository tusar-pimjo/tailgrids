## API Reference

### TimePicker

| Prop       | Type                   | Default | Description                                        |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `children` | `React.ReactNode`      | —       | Trigger element (usually `TimePickerTrigger`)      |
| `onSelect` | `(date: Date) => void` | —       | Callback when hour/minute/period selection updates |

### TimePickerTrigger

Extends `Button` props from `react-aria-components`.

| Prop        | Type          | Description                          |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `className` | `string`      | Custom styles for the trigger button |
| `...props`  | `ButtonProps` | All button props supported           |

### TimeColumn (internal)

Not exported publicly. Renders the scrollable list for hours, minutes, and period.

## Accessibility

- Uses `MenuTrigger` and `Popover` from `react-aria` for proper ARIA roles and keyboard support.
- Popover automatically manages focus and closes on selection.
- Each time value is rendered as a button for full keyboard accessibility.
- Scrollable regions keep navigation intuitive and friendly on touch devices.

## Notes

- Hours are displayed in 12-hour format with AM/PM toggles.
- All columns are scrollable and optimized for vertical picking.
- The helper `toDate` converts the selected values into a valid JavaScript `Date`.
- `onSelect` fires immediately when any part of the time is chosen (hour, minute, or period).
