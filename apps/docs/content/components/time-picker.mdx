# Time Picker

React Time Picker components allow users to select a specific time value using a clear, scrollable interface. They are commonly used in booking forms, scheduling flows, reminders, and time-based filters.

This Time Picker is built with React and uses `react-aria` primitives for accessibility and focus management. It provides scrollable columns for hours, minutes, and AM/PM selection, making time selection fast and predictable.

## API Reference

### TimePicker
The root container responsible for managing time selection state.

| Prop       | Type                   | Default | Description                                        |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `children` | `React.ReactNode`      | —       | Trigger element (usually `TimePickerTrigger`)      |
| `onSelect` | `(date: Date) => void` | —       | Callback when hour/minute/period selection updates |

### TimePickerTrigger

Extends `Button` props from `react-aria-components`.

| Prop        | Type          | Description                          |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `className` | `string`      | Custom styles for the trigger button |
| `...props`  | `ButtonProps` | All button props supported           |

### TimeColumn (internal)

Not exported publicly. Renders the scrollable list for hours, minutes, and period.

## Accessibility

- Uses `MenuTrigger` and `Popover` from `react-aria` for proper ARIA roles and keyboard support.
- Full keyboard navigation support for all time values
- Popover automatically manages focus and closes on selection.
- Each selectable time value is rendered as a native `<button>`
- Works correctly with screen readers and assistive technologies

## Notes

- Uses a 12-hour format with AM/PM selection
- Hour, minute, and period columns are independently scrollable
- The helper `toDate` converts the selected values into a valid JavaScript `Date`.
- `onSelect` fires immediately when any part of the time is chosen (hour, minute, or period).
- Optimized for mouse, keyboard, and touch interactions
