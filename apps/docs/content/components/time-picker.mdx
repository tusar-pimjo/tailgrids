# Time Picker

React Time Picker components allow users to select a specific time value using a clear, scrollable interface. They are commonly used in booking forms, scheduling flows, reminders, and time-based filters.

This Time Picker is built with React and uses `react-aria` primitives for accessibility and focus management. It provides scrollable columns for hours, minutes, and AM/PM selection, making time selection fast and predictable.

<ComponentPreview
  codeSnippet={getFileContent(
    "/src/components/preview/time-picker/time-picker-preview.tsx"
  )}
>
  <TimePickerPreview />
</ComponentPreview>

## Installation

The Time Picker relies on the `react-aria-components` and `react-stately` libraries.

<Accordions defaultValue="CLI">
<Accordion title="CLI">
Install the component using the Tailgrids CLI.
```npm
npx @tailgrids/cli add time-picker
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Manual">

Install the required dependencies:

```npm
npm i react-aria-components react-stately
```

Copy and paste the component code into your project.

<CodeBlockCard
  snippet={getFileContent("/src/registry/core/time-picker.tsx")}
  lang="tsx"
  fileName="time-picker.tsx"
/>
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Anatomy

Import the component and pass the required props.

```tsx
import { TimePicker, TimePickerTrigger } from "@/registry/core/time-picker";

export const TimePickerExample = () => (
  <TimePicker onSelect={date => console.log(date)}>
    <TimePickerTrigger>Select Time</TimePickerTrigger>
  </TimePicker>
);
```

## Examples

### Basic Usage

A standard time picker implementation using `react-aria` for accessibility. It provides a trigger button that opens a popover with scrollable columns for hours, minutes, and AM/PM selection.

<ComponentPreview
  codeSnippet={getFileContent(
    "/src/components/preview/time-picker/time-picker-preview.tsx"
  )}
>
  <TimePickerPreview />
</ComponentPreview>

### With Label

You can combine the Time Picker with a label and other elements to create a complete form control.

<ComponentPreview
  codeSnippet={getFileContent(
    "/src/components/preview/time-picker/time-picker-label-preview.tsx"
  )}
>
  <TimePickerLabelPreview />
</ComponentPreview>

### Custom Trigger

The `TimePickerTrigger` can be customized or replaced with any element that accepts refs and props.

<ComponentPreview
  codeSnippet={getFileContent(
    "/src/components/preview/time-picker/time-picker-custom-trigger-preview.tsx"
  )}
>
  <TimePickerCustomTriggerPreview />
</ComponentPreview>

## API Reference

### TimePicker

| Prop       | Type                   | Default | Description                                        |
| :--------- | :--------------------- | :------ | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `children` | `React.ReactNode`      | -       | Trigger element (usually `TimePickerTrigger`)      |
| `onSelect` | `(date: Date) => void` | -       | Callback when hour/minute/period selection updates |

### TimePickerTrigger

Extends `Button` props from `react-aria-components`.

| Prop        | Type          | Description                          |
| :---------- | :------------ | :----------------------------------- |
| `className` | `string`      | Custom styles for the trigger button |
| `...props`  | `ButtonProps` | All button props supported           |

## Accessibility

- **Keyboard Support**: Full keyboard navigation support for all time values.
- **Screen Readers**: Works correctly with screen readers and assistive technologies.
- **Focus Management**: Popover automatically manages focus and closes on selection to trigger.
- **Semantic HTML**: Uses `MenuTrigger` and `Popover` from `react-aria` for proper ARIA roles.
