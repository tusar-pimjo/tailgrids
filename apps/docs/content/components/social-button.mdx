## API Reference

### SocialButton

Extends `button` element props and inherits all Button component props.

| Prop        | Type              | Default | Description                    |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| `children`  | `React.ReactNode` | -       | Button content (icon and text) |
| `className` | `string`          | -       | Additional CSS classes         |
| `disabled`  | `boolean`         | `false` | Disable button interaction     |
| `onClick`   | `() => void`      | -       | Click event handler            |

## Accessibility

- Built on top of the [Button](./button) component with all its accessibility features
- Includes focus ring styling for keyboard navigation
- Disabled state reduces icon opacity and prevents interaction
- Icons inherit text color for consistent styling
- All standard button HTML attributes are supported

## Notes

- Uses the Button component with `appearance="outline"` by default
- Has a consistent max width of `336px` (21rem) via `max-w-84`
- Full width within the max-width constraint via `w-full`
- Icons maintain 60% opacity when button is disabled
- Typically used with brand icons from social platforms
- Common pattern in authentication flows and social sharing features
