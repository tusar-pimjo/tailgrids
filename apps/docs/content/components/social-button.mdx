# Social Button

React Social Button components are used to display branded action buttons for social authentication or sharing. They are commonly seen in sign-in flows such as “Continue with Google”, “Sign in with GitHub”, or similar third-party actions.

This component focuses only on **visual presentation**. It does not handle authentication logic. It is built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS to ensure consistent sizing, alignment, and icon spacing across different providers.
